## Me

I am a .NET developer since 2008-ish. I've been working with Microsoft technologies for over a decade and a half, watching the evolution of the platform from its early days to the modern cross-platform .NET we have today.

## Why This Blog?

I use this space to structure my thoughts on various subjects. Writing helps me clarify my thinking and deepen my understanding of technical concepts. The posts you'll find here represent my journey through different technical challenges, interesting solutions, and occasional reflections on software development.

## What You'll Find Here

This blog contains my personal notes, tutorials, code snippets, and thoughts on:

- .NET development
- Software architecture
- Programming best practices
- Solutions to problems I've encountered
- Anything else that catches my interest in the tech world

Feel free to explore the posts, and I hope you find something useful or interesting along the way.

## A Note on Content

I might use AI to fix some grammar mistakes and write some boilerplate words (such as this very About section), but if knowledge is shared through a post, it means that it was explained by me with grammar fixes by AI (potentially). The technical content and insights in the posts are my own thoughts and experiences, just occasionally polished for clarity.
